Hrs of fun.  My grandkids love it. Great entertainment when waiting in long linesThis is a very entertaining game!  You don't have to be smart to play it.  I guess that's why I like it...it's easy and fun and that's what games are suppose to be.  Be warned: this game is highly addictive.this is awesome and you don't need wi ti to play trust me. it is really fun and addicting. there are like 100 levels it is even free don't waste your money on the expensive one I mean seriously. get the appthis is awesome I bet no one even reads the reviews because they know this game is so good that they don't need toThis is basicly the free version but with ads. That's actually awesome!!!! It's addicting and free at the same time really. I'd reccomend it.this is by far the best free app that is available anywhere. it has helped pass the time when nothing else would do. don't pass this one up. PS I hate this 20 word minimum!This is definitely a great  to get my 6-year-old grand-nephew to teach me the tricks.  I have figured out some of them, but some configurations are tough to beat.  I don't particularly care spending about 45 minutes  completing a level, but this. is fun an time consuming. works great on my kindle fire I really like this game so does my btotherThis is good if you like physics games, free games, or bird games. Not like free version on ipod. You get all the levels and the only adds pop up in the corner and are barely noticeable.This is great! This is my tried & true game to cure boredom! Its great to try & get 3 stars on every level!this is one of the best apps in the world along with all the other angry birds games. great for passing time by.\""
